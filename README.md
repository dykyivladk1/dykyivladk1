### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Vladyslav Dykyi, a machine learning enthusiast and student at Johannes Kepler University. Here's a little about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis in machine learning, focusing on enhancing object detection algorithms for autonomous vehicles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced topics in AI and exploring deep learning models like GANs and LSTM for various applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source machine learning projects or web scraping tools.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding complex neural network architectures, especially those involved in generative models.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, machine learning, PyTorch, and my experiences with web scraping.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [vladdikiy17@gmail.com]
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not studying AI, I'm probably exploring the beautiful landscapes of Linz, Austria.
