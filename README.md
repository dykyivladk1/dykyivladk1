- **Website**: [http://adify.pro/](http://adify.pro/)  
- ADIFY AI uses the FAISS index and trained transformers, making it highly efficient. It has been trained on 10,000 playlists, allowing it to intelligently select songs and playlists from Spotifyâ€™s vast library based on user mood or activity. By entering a description of the desired playlist (e.g., "chill rock music for studying"), users receive personalized recommendations.

### **FLUXA AI**  
Founder of **Fluxa AI**, an advanced text summarization tool using state-of-the-art transformer models.

- **Website**: [https://www.fluxa.pro/](https://www.fluxa.pro/)  
- Fluxa AI specializes in summarizing text and PDF files, leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and transformer-based summarization models like BART. Fluxa is built for both speed and precision, making it ideal for processing large documents with complex content.

### **WIZA TELEGRAM AI Assistant**  
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/dykyivladk1/WIZA/blob/main/wiza_clearlogo.png?raw=true" width="150">
Founder of the WIZA Telegram bot, a comprehensive travel assistant supporting 39 countries and 462 cities.  
- Features include top-rated restaurants and hotels, currency conversion, local taxi services, nearby hospitals, shopping centers, apartment rentals, emergency contacts, and an events section.  
- The bot utilizes a proprietary WIZA search engine and supports multiple languages for a seamless travel experience.

### **AI NYX Model**  
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/dykyivladk1/NYX/raw/main/assets/logo.png" width="150">
NYX is a Transformer-based neural architecture designed for autoregressive natural language generation tasks. The model leverages positional rotary embeddings, multi-head self-attention, and low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient, scalable training. The architecture is implemented using PyTorch and provides modular flexibility to suit a variety of NLP applications, including text generation, completion, and language modeling.
