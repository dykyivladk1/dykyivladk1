- **Website**: [http://adify.pro/](http://adify.pro/)  
- ADIFY AI uses the FAISS index and trained transformers, making it highly efficient. It has been trained on 10,000 playlists, allowing it to intelligently select songs and playlists from Spotifyâ€™s vast library based on user mood or activity. By entering a description of the desired playlist (e.g., "chill rock music for studying"), users receive personalized recommendations.

### **WIZA TELEGRAM AI Assistant**  
Founder of the WIZA Telegram bot, a comprehensive travel assistant supporting 39 countries and 462 cities.  
- Features include top-rated restaurants and hotels, currency conversion, local taxi services, nearby hospitals, shopping centers, apartment rentals, emergency contacts, and an events section.  
- The bot utilizes a proprietary WIZA search engine and supports multiple languages for a seamless travel experience.

### **POLIP**  
Founder of the POLIP library, a toolkit for Machine Learning developers, designed to enhance model performance.  
- POLIP provides custom implementations to improve efficiency and accuracy in machine learning models.

### ** AI NYX Model**  
NYX is a Transformer-based neural architecture designed for autoregressive natural language generation tasks. The model leverages positional rotary embeddings, multi-head self-attention, and low-rank adaptation techniques for efficient, scalable training. The architecture is implemented using PyTorch and provides modular flexibility to suit a variety of NLP applications, including text generation, completion, and language modeling.
